= Wireless Network Localization

== Research summary
Location-awareness plays a crucial role in many wireless network applications, such as localization services in next generation cellular networks, search-and-rescue operations, logistics, and blue force tracking in battlefields. The global positioning system (GPS) is the most important technology to provide location-awareness around the globe through a constellation of at least 24 satellites. However, the effectiveness of GPS is limited in harsh environments, such as in buildings, in urban canyons, under tree canopies, and in caves, due to the inability of GPS signals to penetrate most obstacles. Hence, new localization techniques are required to meet the increasing need for accurate localization in such harsh environments. \n
Our research interests revolve around following directions:\n
- Theoretical analysis framework, distributed algorithm design and resource allocation for relative localization\n
- Localization techniques based on polarization sensitive array \n
- Single satellite positioning system based on Doppler information \n
- 5G positioning system based on SRS signal \n
- Network localization and synchronization using full-duplex radios \n
- Beamspace direct localization; 
- Tensor-based multipath estimation\n
- Joint active and passive localization framework against clock drifts \n
- Passive anchor assisted localization scheme \n
- Bluetooth indoor localization algorithm design \n
- Localizability of large-scale networks \n
- Algorithm design and hardware implementation of indoor localization for Wi-Fi devices based on tensor decomposition \n
