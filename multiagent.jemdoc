= Cooperative Multi-agent Networks

== Research summary
Multi-agent networks have exhibited increasingly prominent features of self-adaptation and collaboration due to the rapid development of information technology. The study of cooperative sensing and communication for autonomous unmanned systems, as well as cooperative control and optimization decision-making, and the formation of an innovative theoretical system framework for autonomous intelligent unmanned systems are of great significance to the growth of smart industries and the cultivation of smart society. Collaboration capability for multi-agent mobile networks has huge application potential and practical value in both military and civilian scenarios. \n

We are focusing on the following research directions: 
- Cooperative detection in mobile multi-agent networks; 
- Large-scale cooperative localization
- Joint localization and formation of multi-agent networks
- Cooperative visual perception in multi-agent networks
- Flocking algorithm with collision avoidance
- Theoretical framework and algorithm design of multi-agent cooperative formation based on integrated localization and control
- Information coupling theory in cooperative localization networks
- Cooperative scheduling of high-dynamic intelligent systems
- Deep reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent networks
