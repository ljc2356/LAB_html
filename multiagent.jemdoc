= Cooperative Multi-agent Networks

== Research summary
Multi-agent networks have exhibited increasingly prominent features of self-adaptation and collaboration due to the rapid development of information technology. The study of cooperative sensing and communication for autonomous unmanned systems, as well as cooperative control and optimization decision-making, and the formation of an innovative theoretical system framework for autonomous intelligent unmanned systems are of great significance to the growth of smart industries and the cultivation of smart society. Collaboration capability for multi-agent mobile networks has huge application potential and practical value in both military and civilian scenarios. \n

We are focusing on the following research directions: 
- Cooperative detection in mobile multi-agent networks; 
- Large-scale cooperative localization
- Joint localization and formation of multi-agent networks
- Cooperative visual perception in multi-agent networks
- Flocking algorithm with collision avoidance
- Theoretical framework and algorithm design of multi-agent cooperative formation based on integrated localization and control
- Information coupling theory in cooperative localization networks
- Cooperative scheduling of high-dynamic intelligent systems
- Deep reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent networks

- We propose a statistical framework for cooperative visual 3D perception in multi-agent networks. A metric based on statistical analysis is designed to evaluate the dependence of reconstruction quality on visual sensor deployment. The temporal and spatial cooperation for optimal sensor deployment is exploited.\n

- A new flocking algorithm with collision avoidance is proposed by constructing a novel potential function. We analyze the stability of the flocking algorithm proposed by the predecessors with Lyapunov's theory. The upper bounds of steady states are derived. Then the continuous-time system is discretized and sampled periodically and corresponding convergence results are derived according to the characteristics of digital chips.
